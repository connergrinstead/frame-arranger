# Frame Arranger

The main purpose of this project was to get familiar with OpenCV2.

This tool allows a user to select an area on an image, which the program then duplicates a certain amount of times and evenly spaces into a set area.

It is useful to visualize the spacing of items such as picture frames on a wall.
